# Music Player 

This is a project that I undertook while learning JavaScript after completing HTML and CSS. I have always believed in learning through projects, relying on one's own intellect and research capabilities to complete a project. Utilizing AI is also a form of research nowadays, and ChatGPT has been my most valuable companion throughout this project. More than 90% of the problems I encountered during this project were solved with the assistance of Mr. GPT.

I have recently completed a crash course on JavaScript, so I would like to set appropriate expectations regarding my proficiency. Despite my limited experience, I have put forth my best effort and successfully integrated fundamental functionalities such as pausing, playing, forwarding, and backwarding. Additionally, I have implemented a feature that displays the effects of these actions in the list of songs alongside the player interface.
